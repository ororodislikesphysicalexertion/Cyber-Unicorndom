## Welcome to My *Magical* Cybercave!

Hi! First and foremost, I should warn you that the title is deceiving. At the moment, this is just a place to share some of my emotional bullcrap or things I've learned along the way, but as I seemingly progress as an individual, I may also talk about my projects or ideas. Anyways, enjoy (if you can)!

## Beauty

### The Couple Inside Me
The blues and sunshine churn and meddle together inside me. They are like yin and yang, too much of one is overpowering and out of my control. Together, they make me a sad, lonesome soul but filled with love and serenity. There is so much beauty in the ugly, and so much ugly in the beauty. Nonetheless, there is so much beauty everywhere-- some things are just not traditionally beautiful. Such things include the gentle touch of foreign skin, a rude whisper snapping the silence in your heart, and the uncomfortable wetness of your cheeks when you cry. A good weep is quite stabilizing. Those little puddles are only salty because they are the product of a mind in despair, but lick them again and you will notice that they taste sweet-- that happens when you seek the comfort of the beauty in ugly.


## Monster Battles

### Fight One
Putting all the cycles of self-loathing aside, I think I am comfortable in my own skin. If I wasn’t, I would try to act like someone I’m not, and maybe I wouldn't have been honest about my internal conflicts. But what's with the rollercoaster of negativity? Maybe I’m just so used to feeling inadequate and unhappy that I return to hating myself for seeming comfort. However, I realized that when I keep the monster in me chained, and push those thoughts out instead of to the back of my mind, I feel much safer being inside me. Be filled by wonder and pureness to replace the mind’s self-destructive contraption.

### Fight Two
Sometimes I suffer from so much inferiority complex. _Everyone is better than me in every regard, I’m a bad person and I look bad and talk bad._ Sometimes it can be easy to get absorbed in these thoughts to the point where even metacognition cannot interrupt my mind revelling in its filthy self-loathing. I worry that if I always loathe myself so much, I will end up trying to become a person below my standards. These awful feelings weren't as frequent and extreme till I was constantly trapped in solitude during the pandemic. I gradually stopped becoming less comfortable and happy with myself as intrusive thoughts ravaged my peace. I sometimes hate being average and ugly, I wish I was more. I wish I was prettier and smarter and kinder and a better person. Some of these things are out of my control, and the thought of a person can also trigger this mindset. What’s worse is that I despise the sort of thinking that makes me compare myself to others- it makes me feel like I don’t want to be my own friend, and I wonder why I still have other friends when I am like this at times! No matter how much better I get within my abilities, I’ll always be average, and I feel even worse thinking that I won’t ever be happy with myself. It’s nice to cry when these emotions are overwhelming, of course. But it helps even more to recognize and control the beginnings of those thoughts before they overcome you. Who do you want to be? A person of value, a good person- selfless, kind, hardworking, understanding, honest, respectful, and beyond! Once you finish crying, aspire to embody the values that are most important to you, and muster up the motivation to get better in whatever you want that makes you feel comfortable. Don’t worry about the comparisons and the inadequacy, they’ll always be there lurking in the dark- do you think lurkers are nice? No, of course not! So fight them away, out of your mind and into an unknown dark alley that you’ll never visit, and you will find yourself in a far better place. If anyone brings out the lurkers, fight them with a great big ball of beautiful energy. Strengthen the walls of your inner peace and love so that no one can knock you over-- no one!!
