## Welcome to My *Magical* Cybercave!

Hi! First and foremost, I should warn you that the title is deceiving. At the moment, this is just a place to share some of my emotional bullcrap or things I've learned along the way, but as I seemingly progress as an individual, I may also talk about my projects or ideas. Anyways, enjoy (if you can)!

## Beauty

### The Couple Inside Me
The blues and sunshine churn and meddle together inside me. They are like yin and yang, together they create harmony but too much of one is overpowering and out of my control. Together, they make me a sad, lonesome soul but filled with love, appreciation and serenity. There is so much beauty in the ugly, and so much ugly in the beauty. Nonetheless, there is so much beauty everywhere-- some things are just not traditionally beautiful. Such things include the gentle touch of foreign skin, a rude whisper snapping the silence in your heart, and the uncomfortable wetness of your cheeks when you cry. A good weep is quite stabilizing. Those little puddles are only salty because they are the product of a mind in despair, but lick them again and you will notice that they taste sweet-- that happens when you seek the comfort of the beauty in ugly.

## Monster Battles

### Fight One
Putting all the cycles of self-loathing aside, I think I am comfortable in my own skin. If I wasn’t, I would try to act like someone I’m not, and maybe I wouldn't have been honest about my internal conflicts. But what's with the rollercoaster of negativity? Maybe I’m just so used to feeling inadequate and unhappy that I return to hating myself for seeming comfort. However, I realized that when I keep the monster in me chained, and push those thoughts out instead of to the back of my mind, I feel much safer being inside me. I then begin to fill my heart with wonder and pureness to disable the mind’s self-destructive contraption.

### Fight Two
Sometimes I suffer from so much inferiority complex. _Everyone is better than me in every regard, I’m a bad person and I look bad and talk bad._ Sometimes it can be easy to get absorbed in these thoughts to the point where even metacognition cannot interrupt my mind revelling in its filthy self-loathing. I worry that if I always loathe myself so much, I will end up trying to become a person below my standards and self-dignity. These awful feelings weren't as frequent and extreme till I was constantly trapped in solitude during the pandemic. I gradually stopped becoming less comfortable and happy with myself as intrusive thoughts ravaged my peace. I sometimes hate being average and ugly, I wish I was more. I wish I was prettier and smarter and kinder and a better person. Some of these things are out of my control, which makes it feel like I'm invalidly upset. Some of these things are also a result of thinking about people who trigger this mindset and make me feel like I'm not enough. What’s worse is that I despise the sort of thinking that is self-deprecating and makes me compare myself to others- it makes me feel like I don’t want to be my own friend, and I wonder why I still have other friends when I am like this at times! No matter how much better I get within my abilities, I’ll always be average, and I feel even worse thinking that I won’t ever be content with myself because of my mediocrity. A bit of inadequacy keeps us alive by motivating us to pursue goodness and innovation, but too much is often debilitating. 

It’s nice to cry when these emotions are overwhelming, of course. But it helps even more to recognize and control the beginnings of those thoughts before they overcome you. If you've felt similar to the way I feel sometimes, it's good to keep some of the following in mind. Firstly, who do you want to be? I know I want to be a good person of value-- selfless, kind, hardworking, understanding, honest, respectful, and beyond. Once you finish crying, aspire to embody the values that are most important to you, and muster up the motivation to get better in whatever you want that makes you feel comfortable. This only applies if your motivations are good. If your values are shite, don't take my advice. Focus on what's right, and then you don't have to worry about being average. Being average was never a bad thing in the first place. Don’t worry about the comparisons and the intense inadequacy, they’ll always be there lurking in the dark. Fight them away, out of your mind and into an unknown dark alley that you’ll never visit, and you will find yourself in a far better place. Care about what other people think of you if it's personally beneficial, so practice selectively caring. Otherwise, there is no need to worry about what they think. If anyone brings out the lurkers, fight them with a great big ball of beautiful energy. Strengthen the walls of your inner peace and love so that no one can knock you over-- no one!!
